XCAMPO

This project will help you to generate different payloads for your XSS demos. Use them responsible in your own website or in these where you are allowed to do.

Don't expect the code works in all the scenario, probably you will need to tweak it most of the times... but I'm pretty sure you know how to do it ;)

Right now XCampo can generate the following payloads:
- Fake login web page
- hax0r defacement
- Form redirection
- Password managers steal information
- Cookie steal 

Some payloads allow different ways to send the information:
- iframe
- redirect
- popup
